              ProteinWeaver is a web-based interface designed to enhance the
              visualization and analysis of protein interaction networks through
              the integration of ontological information.
            </p>
            <p>
              The inspiration for ProteinWeaver came from our collaborators asking the
              question â€œHow does a protein connect to other proteins with a
              specific function?" While many network-based tools exist for predicting protein function
              and visualizing protein networks, a gap existed in the tools to help
              biologists understand a protein's contextual placement in a biological
              framework. Thus, ProteinWeaver was created to facilitate the exploration of protein
              interaction networks, emphasizing protein function.
            </p>
            <p>
              The current version of ProteinWeaver enables users to query a protein
              of interest and its associations with specific functions or processes via gene
              ontology terms. This prompts ProteinWeaver to construct a focused subnetwork,
              connecting the queried protein with others annotated by the specified GO term.
              Users can navigate and delve deeper into these networks using the interactive Cytoscape graph,
              allowing dynamic traversal and the ability to requery by introducing new proteins of interest.
